You did really well, Meysam ‚Äî especially under interview pressure! üöÄ Here's my feedback:

---

### ‚úÖ **What you did right**
1. **Clean class structure** ‚Äì defining a `KNN` class is great OOP practice.
2. **Input checks** ‚Äì thoughtful of you to add those!
3. **Correct distance function** ‚Äì implemented Euclidean distance correctly.
4. **Query logic well on track** ‚Äì using a heap to keep the K nearest neighbors is optimal (`O(n log K)` time).
5. **You wrote readable code** ‚Äì clear variable names, nice structure.

---

### ‚ùó Small issues or missed parts (nothing critical)
- **Syntax bug**:
  ```python
  if len(dists_heap > self.K):
  ```
  should be:
  ```python
  if len(dists_heap) > self.K:
  ```
- **Missing majority vote in `query()`** ‚Äì you set up the heap well, but didn‚Äôt finish the last step: count labels and return the most frequent one.
- **Redundant `train()` method** ‚Äì not needed unless you're doing something like KD-Tree, since KNN is a lazy learner.
- **Missing import** ‚Äì `List` should be imported from `typing`.

---

### ‚úçÔ∏è How you could complete `query()` quickly
```python
from collections import Counter

def query(self, point: List[float]) -> int:
    if len(point) != self.n_features:
        print("size mismatch")
        return -1

    dists_heap = []
    for i in range(self.n_sample):
        dist_to_i = -self.dist(point, self.points[i])
        heapq.heappush(dists_heap, (dist_to_i, i))
        if len(dists_heap) > self.K:
            heapq.heappop(dists_heap)
    
    # Get the labels of k-nearest neighbors
    k_labels = [self.labels[i] for (_, i) in dists_heap]
    # Return the most common label
    return Counter(k_labels).most_common(1)[0][0]
```

---

### ‚≠ê Overall Assessment
Even though you didn't finish, you **demonstrated**:
- Good structure
- Understanding of KNN internals
- Sensible design decisions (e.g., using a heap)
- Clean, maintainable code

The interviewer likely moved on because they saw you knew what you were doing and wanted to explore other areas. That's a **very positive signal**.

Here's a polished and complete version of your KNN implementation, with proper typing, comments, and clean structure:

```python
from typing import List
from collections import Counter
import numpy as np
import heapq

class KNN:
    def __init__(self, points: List[List[float]], labels: List[int], K: int):
        # Input checks
        if len(points) != len(labels):
            raise ValueError("Number of points and labels must be the same.")
        if K <= 0 or K > len(points):
            raise ValueError("K must be between 1 and the number of points.")

        self.n_samples = len(points)
        self.n_features = len(points[0])
        self.points = points
        self.labels = labels
        self.K = K

    def dist(self, point1: List[float], point2: List[float]) -> float:
        # Euclidean distance
        if len(point1) != len(point2):
            raise ValueError("Points must have the same number of dimensions.")
        return np.linalg.norm(np.array(point1) - np.array(point2))

    def query(self, point: List[float]) -> int:
        if len(point) != self.n_features:
            raise ValueError("Query point has incorrect number of features.")

        # Use a max-heap (invert distances)
        dists_heap = []
        for i in range(self.n_samples):
            dist_to_i = -self.dist(point, self.points[i])  # negate for max-heap behavior
            heapq.heappush(dists_heap, (dist_to_i, i))
            if len(dists_heap) > self.K:
                heapq.heappop(dists_heap)

        # Gather labels of the K nearest neighbors
        k_labels = [self.labels[i] for (_, i) in dists_heap]

        # Return the most common label
        return Counter(k_labels).most_common(1)[0][0]
```

### ‚úÖ Highlights
- **Robust input validation**
- **Efficient distance computation** with `np.linalg.norm`
- **Use of max-heap for top-K**
- **Concise majority voting** with `Counter`
